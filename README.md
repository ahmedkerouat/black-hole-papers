# Black Hole Papers

## About the project

This is an automated list of black hole papers, thanks to the arxiv api. (Black holes, hands down, is my favorite cosmic topic.)  
I confess that automation is my way of embracing a bit of laziness. When I finish a book I'm left with the dilemma of what to read next, this would then be a great way to face this issue.

| [Exact Black String Solutions in Three Dimensions](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9108001v1) | James H. Horne, Gary T. Horowitz | 1991-08-14 | A family of exact conformal field theories is constructed which describe charged black strings in three dimensions. Unlike previous charged black hole or extended black hole solutions in string theory, the low energy spacetime metric has a regular inner horizon (in addition to the event horizon) and a timelike singularity. As the charge to mass ratio approaches unity, the event horizon remains but the singularity disappears. |
| [String Winding in a Black Hole Geometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9108010v1) | Mordechai Spiegelglas | 1991-08-21 | $U(1)$ zero modes in the $SL(2,R)_k/U(1)$ and $SU(2)_k/U(1)$ conformal coset theories, are investigated in conjunction with the string black hole solution. The angular variable in the Euclidean version, is found to have a double set of winding. Region III is shown to be $SU(2)_k/U(1)$ where the doubling accounts for the cut sructure of the parafermionic amplitudes and fits nicely across the horizon and singularity. The implications for string thermodynamics and identical particles correlations are discussed. |
| [On the Perturbations of String-Theoretic Black Holes](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9108012v1) | Gerald Gilbert | 1991-08-22 | The perturbations of string-theoretic black holes are analyzed by generalizing the method of Chandrasekhar. Attention is focussed on the case of the recently considered charged string-theoretic black hole solutions as a representative example. It is shown that string-intrinsic effects greatly alter the perturbed motions of the string-theoretic black holes as compared to the perturbed motions of black hole solutions of the field equations of general relativity, the consequences of which bear on the questions of the scattering behavior and the stability of string-theoretic black holes. The explicit forms of the axial potential barriers surrounding the string-theoretic black hole are derived. It is demonstrated that one of these, for sufficiently negative values of the asymptotic value of the dilaton field, will inevitably become negative in turn, in marked contrast to the potentials surrounding the static black holes of general relativity. Such potentials may in principle be used in some cases to obtain approximate constraints on the value of the string coupling constant. The application of the perturbation analysis to the case of two-dimensional string-theoretic black holes is discussed. |
| [Superstring Compactification and Target Space Duality](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9108022v1) | John H. Schwarz | 1991-08-26 | This review talk focusses on some of the interesting developments in the area of superstring compactification that have occurred in the last couple of years. These include the discovery that ``mirror symmetric" pairs of Calabi--Yau spaces, with completely distinct geometries and topologies, correspond to a single (2,2) conformal field theory. Also, the concept of target-space duality, originally discovered for toroidal compactification, is being extended to Calabi--Yau spaces. It also associates sets of geometrically distinct manifolds to a single conformal field theory.   A couple of other topics are presented very briefly. One concerns conceptual challenges in reconciling gravity and quantum mechanics. It is suggested that certain ``distasteful allegations" associated with quantum gravity such as loss of quantum coherence, unpredictability of fundamental parameters of particle physics, and paradoxical features of black holes are likely to be circumvented by string theory. Finally there is a brief discussion of the importance of supersymmetry at the TeV scale, both from a practical point of view and as a potentially significant prediction of string theory. |
| [Superstring in Two Dimensional Black Hole](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9108026v2) | Shin'ichi Nojiri | 1991-08-29 | We construct superstring theory in two dimensional black hole background based on supersymmetric $SU(1,1)/U(1)$ gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten model. |
| [Effective Superstrings](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9109008v1) | Zhu Yang | 1991-09-05 | We generalize the method of quantizing effective strings proposed by Polchinski and Strominger to superstrings. The Ramond-Neveu-Schwarz string is different from the Green-Schwarz string in non-critical dimensions. Both are anomaly-free and Poincare invariant. Some implications of the results are discussed. The formal analogy with 4D (super)gravity is pointed out. |
| [Some Applications of String Field Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9109022v1) | Ashoke Sen | 1991-09-12 | We study general properties of the classical solutions in non-polynomial closed string field theory and their relationship with two dimensional conformal field theories. In particular we discuss how different conformal field theories which are related by marginal or nearly marginal deformations can be regarded as different classical solutions of some underlying string field theory. We also discuss construction of a classical solution labelled by infinite number of parameters in string field theory in two dimensions. For a specific set of values of the parameters the solution can be identified to the black hole solution. |
| [String Effective Action and Two Dimensional Charged Black Hole](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9109026v1) | S. Pratik Khastgir, Alok Kumar | 1991-09-14 | Graviton-dilaton background field equations in three space-time dimensions, following from the string effective action are solved when the metric has only time dependence. By taking one of the two space dimensions as compact, our solution reproduces a recently discovered charged black hole solution in two space-time dimensions. Solutions in presence of nonvanishing three dimensional background antisymmetric tensor field are also discussed. |
| [On the connection between Quantum Mechanics and the geometry of two-dimensional strings](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9109027v1) | J. Ellis, N. E. Mavromatos, D. V. Nanopoulos | 1991-09-17 | On the basis of an area-preserving symmetry in the phase space of a one-dimensional matrix model - believed to describe two-dimensional string theory in a black-hole background which also allows for space-time foam - we give a geometric interpretation of the fact that two-dimensional stringy black holes are consistent with conventional quantum mechanics due to the infinite gauged `W-hair' property that characterises them. |
| [Beyond the Large N Limit: Non-linear W(infinity) as symmetry of the SL(2,R)/U(1) coset model](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9109029v1) | I. Bakas, E. Kiritsis | 1991-09-18 | We show that the symmetry algebra of the $SL(2,R)_{k}/U(1)$ coset model is a non-linear deformation of $W_{\infty}$, characterized by $k$. This is a universal $W$-algebra which linearizes in the large $k$ limit and truncates to $W_{N}$ for $k=-N$. Using the theory of non-compact parafermions we construct a free field realization of the non-linear $W_{\infty}$ in terms of two bosons with background charge. The $W$-characters of all unitary $SL(2,R)/U(1)$ representations are computed. Applications to the physics of 2-d black hole backgrounds are also discussed and connections with the KP approach to $c=1$ string theory are outlined. |
| [Elements of String Cosmology](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9109048v1) | A. A. Tseytlin, C. Vafa | 1991-09-25 | Aspects of string cosmology for critical and non-critical strings are discussed emphasizing the necessity to account for the dilaton dynamics for a proper incorporation of ``large - small" duality. This drastically modifies the intuition one has with Einstein's gravity. For example winding modes, even though contribute to energy density, oppose expansion and if not annihilated will stop the expansion. Moreover we find that the radiation dominated era of the standard cosmology emerges quite naturally in string cosmology. Our analysis of non-critical string cosmology provides a reinterpretation of the (universal cover of the) recently studied two dimensional black hole solution as a conformal realization of cosmological solutions found previously by Mueller. |
| [Manifestly $O(d,d)$ Invariant Approach to Space-Time Dependent String Vacua](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9110004v1) | K. A. Meissner, G. Veneziano | 1991-10-01 | An $O(d,d)$ symmetry of the manifold of string vacua that do not depend on $d$ (out of $D$) space-time coordinates has been recently identified. Here we write down, for $d=D-1$, the low energy equations of motion and their general solution in a manifestly $O(d,d)$-invariant form, pointing out an amusing similarity with the renormalization group framework. Previously considered cosmological and black hole solutions are recovered as particular examples. |
| [Open String Theory in 1+1 Dimensions](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9110034v1) | M. Bershadsky, D. Kutasov | 1991-10-14 | We show that tree level open two dimensional string theory is exactly solvable; the solution exhibits some unusual features, and is qualitatively different from the closed case. The open string ``tachyon'' S -- matrix describes free fermions, which can be interpreted as the quarks at the ends of the string. These ``quarks'' live naturally on a lattice in space-time. We also find an exact vacuum solution of the theory, corresponding to a charged black hole. |
| [Superspace WZW Models and Black Holes](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9110035v1) | Changhyun Ahn, Martin Rocek, Kareljan Schoutens, Alexander Sevrin | 1991-10-14 | We show how to write an off-shell action for the $SU(2)\times U(1)$ supersymmetric WZW model in terms of $N=2$ chiral and twisted chiral multiplets. We discuss the $N=4$ supersymmetry of this model and exhibit the $N=4$ superconformal current algebra. Finally, we show that the off-shell formulation makes it possible to perform a duality transformation, which leads to a supersymmetric sigma model on a manifold with a black hole type singularity. |
| [(Super-) String in Two Dimensional Black Hole and Target Space Dualities](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9110044v2) | Shin'ichi Nojiri | 1991-10-17 | We review the recently proposed string theory in two dimensional black hole background. Especially, the structure of the duality in the target space is discussed. The duality is analogous to \lq\lq $R \rightarrow 1/R$" symmetry of a compactified boson. We consider the duality in more general target space manifolds which have Killing symmetries and we give an explicit formula which connects two different manifolds which are dual to each other. Superstring theory in two dimensional black hole background is also discussed based on supersymmetric $SU(1,1)/U(1)$ gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten model. |
| [Generalized Duality and Singular Strings in Higher Dimensions](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9110054v2) | I. Bars, K. Sfetsos | 1991-10-18 | Deformations of gauged WZW actions are constructed for any pair $(G,H)$ by taking different embeddings of the gauge group $H\subset G$ as it acts on the left and right of the group element $g$. This leads to models that are dual to each other, generalizing the axial/vector duality of the two dimensional black hole manifold. The classical equations are completely solved for any pair $(G,H)$ and in particular for the anti de Sitter string based on $SO(d- 1,2)/SO(d-1,1)$ for which the normal modes are determined. Duality is demonstrated for models that have the same set of normal modes. Concentrating on $SO(2,2)/SO(2,1)$, the metric and dilaton fields of the $d=3$ string as well as some of the dual generalizations are obtained. They have curvature singularities and represent new singular solutions of Einstein's general relativity in three dimensions. |
| [Some Exact Solutions of String Theory in Four and Five Dimensions](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9110067v1) | Petr Horava | 1991-10-24 | We find several classes of exact classical solutions of critical bosonic string theory, constructed as twisted products of one Euclidean and one Minkowskian 2D black hole coset. One class of these solutions leads (after tensoring with free scalars and supersymmetrizing) to a rotating version of the recently discovered exact black fivebrane. Another class represents a one-parameter family of axisymmetric stationary four-dimensional targets with horizons. Global properties and target duality of the 4D solutions are briefly analyzed. |
| [Non-Compact WZW Conformal Field Theories](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9110076v1) | Krzysztof Gawedzki | 1991-10-31 | We discuss non-compact WZW sigma models, especially the ones with symmetric space $H^{\bf C}/H$ as the target, for $H$ a compact Lie group. They offer examples of non-rational conformal field theories. We remind their relation to the compact WZW models but stress their distinctive features like the continuous spectrum of conformal weights, diverging partition functions and the presence of two types of operators analogous to the local and non-local insertions recently discussed in the Liouville theory. Gauging non-compact abelian subgroups of $H^{\bf C}$ leads to non-rational coset theories. In particular, gauging one-parameter boosts in the $SL(2,\bC)/SU(2)$ model gives an alternative, explicitly stable construction of a conformal sigma model with the euclidean 2D black hole target. We compute the (regularized) toroidal partition function and discuss the spectrum of the theory. A comparison is made with more standard approach based on the $U(1)$ coset of the $SU(1,1)$ WZW theory where stability is not evident but where unitarity becomes more transparent. |
| [Topological Field Theories and Space-Time Singularity](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9111001v1) | Tohru Eguchi | 1991-11-01 | Based on a study of recently proposed solution of 2 dim. black hole we argue that the space-time singularities of general relativity may be described by topological field theories (TFTs). We also argue that in general TFT is a field theory which decsribes singular configurations with a reduced holonomy in its field space. |
| [On the Evaporation of Black Holes in String Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9111031v1) | J. Ellis, N. E. Mavromatos, D. V. Nanopoulos | 1991-11-18 | We show that, in string theory, the quantum evaporation and decay of black holes in two-dimensional target space is related to imaginary parts in higher-genus string amplitudes. These arise from the regularisation of modular infinities due to the sum over world-sheet configurations, that are known to express the instabilities of massive string states in general, and are not thermal in character. The absence of such imaginary parts in the matrix model limit confirms that the latter constitutes the final stage of the evaporation process, at least in perturbation theory. Our arguments appear to be quite generic, related only to the summation over world-sheet surfaces, and hence should also apply to higher-dimensional target spaces. |
| [Charged Black Holes in Two-Dimensional String Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9111038v1) | Michael D. McGuigan, Chiara R. Nappi, Scott A. Yost | 1991-11-20 | We discuss two dimensional string theories containing gauge fields introduced either via coupling to open strings, in which case we get a Born-Infeld type action, or via heterotic compactification. The solutions to the modified background field equations are charged black holes which exhibit interesting space-time geometries. We also compute their masses and charges. |
| [Instabilities in the gravitational background and string theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9111041v1) | Anirvan M. Sengupta | 1991-11-21 | We indicate the tentative source of instability in the two-dimensional black hole background. There are relevant operators among the tachyon and the higher level vertex operators in the conformal field theory. Connection of this instability with Hawking radiation is not obvious. The situation is somewhat analogous to fields in the background of a negative mass Euclidean Schwarzschild solution (in four dimensions). Speculation is made about decay of the Minkowski black hole into finite temperature flat space. |
| ["the Instability of String-Theoretic Black Holes"](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9111042v1) | Gerald Gilbert | 1991-11-21 | It is demonstrated that static, charged, spherically--symmetric black holes in string theory are classically and catastrophically unstable to linearized perturbations in four dimensions, and moreover that unstable modes appear for arbitrarily small positive values of the charge. This catastrophic classical instability dominates and is distinct from much smaller and less significant effects such as possible quantum mechanical evaporation. The classical instability of the string--theoretic black hole contrasts sharply with the situation which obtains for the Reissner--Nordstr\"om black hole of general relativity, which has been shown by Chandrasekhar to be perfectly stable to linearized perturbations at the event horizon. |
| [Modified Black Holes in Two Dimensional Gravity](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9111044v1) | N. Mohammedi | 1991-11-22 | The $SL(2,R)/U(1)$ gauged WZWN model is modified by a topological term and the accompanying change in the geometry of the two dimensional target space is determined. The possibility of this additional term arises from a symmetry in the general formalism of gauging an isometry subgroup of a non-linear sigma model with an antisymmetric tensor. It is shown, in particular, that the space-time exhibits some general singularities for which the recently found black hole is just a special case. From a conformal field theory point of view and for special values of the unitary representations of $SL(2,R)$, this topological term can be interpreted as a small perturbation by a (1,1) conformal operator of the gauged WZWN action. |
| [A Classical Instability of Reissner-Nordstrom Solutions and the Fate of Magnetically Charged Black Holes](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9111045v2) | K. Lee, V. P. Nair, E. J. Weinberg | 1991-11-22 | Working in the context of spontaneously broken gauge theories, we show that the magnetically charged Reissner-Nordstrom solution develops a classical instability if the horizon is sufficiently small. This instability has significant implications for the evolution of a magnetically charged black hole. In particular, it leads to the possibility that such a hole could evaporate completely, leaving in its place a nonsingular magnetic monopole. |
| [On Black Holes In String Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9111052v1) | Edward Witten | 1991-11-25 | In these lecture notes from Strings `91, I briefly sketch the analogy between two dimensional black holes and the s-wave sector of four dimensional black holes, and the physical interest of the latter, particularly in the magnetically charged case. |
| [Evanescent Black Holes](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9111056v1) | C. Callan, S. Giddings, J. Harvey, A. Strominger | 1991-11-28 | A renormalizable theory of quantum gravity coupled to a dilaton and conformal matter in two space-time dimensions is analyzed. The theory is shown to be exactly solvable classically. Included among the exact classical solutions are configurations describing the formation of a black hole by collapsing matter. The problem of Hawking radiation and backreaction of the metric is analyzed to leading order in a $1/N$ expansion, where $N$ is the number of matter fields. The results suggest that the collapsing matter radiates away all of its energy before an event horizon has a chance to form, and black holes thereby disappear from the quantum mechanical spectrum. It is argued that the matter asymptotically approaches a zero-energy ``bound state'' which can carry global quantum numbers and that a unitary $S$-matrix including such states should exist. |
| [Perturbations of a Stringy Black Hole](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9112001v2) | E. Raiten | 1991-12-02 | We extend the three dimensional stringy black hole of Horne and Horowitz to four dimensions. After a brief discussion of the global properties of the metric, we discuss the stability of the background with respect to small perturbations, following the methods of Gilbert and of Chandrasekhar. The potential for axial perturbations is found to be positive definite. |
| [Black Holes in Magnetic Monopoles](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9112008v1) | K. Lee, V. P. Nair, Erick J. Weinberg | 1991-12-04 | We study magnetically charged classical solutions of a spontaneously broken gauge theory interacting with gravity. We show that nonsingular monopole solutions exist only if the Higgs vacuum expectation value $v$ is less than or equal to a critical value $v_{cr}$, which is of the order of the Planck mass. In the limiting case the monopole becomes a black hole, with the region outside the horizon described by the critical Reissner-Nordstrom solution. For $v<v_{cr}$, we find additional solutions which are singular at $r=0$, but which have this singularity hidden within a horizon. These have nontrivial matter fields outside the horizon, and may be interpreted as small black holes lying within a magnetic monopole. The nature of these solutions as a function of $v$ and of the total mass $M$ and their relation to the Reissner-Nordstrom solutions is discussed. |
| [Nonlinear $\hat{W}_{\infty}$ Current Algebra in the SL(2,R)/U(1) Coset Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9112009v1) | Feng Yu, Yong-Shi Wu | 1991-12-04 | Previously we have established that the second Hamiltonian structure of the KP hierarchy is a nonlinear deformation, called $\hat{W}_{\infty}$, of the linear, centerless $W_{\infty}$ algebra. In this letter we present a free-field realization for all generators of $\hat{W}_{\infty}$ in terms of two scalars as well as an elegant generating function for the $\hat{W}_{\infty}$ currents in the classical conformal $SL(2,R)/U(1)$ coset model. After quantization, a quantum deformation of $\hat{W}_{\infty}$ appears as the hidden current algebra in this model. The $\hat{W}_{\infty}$ current algebra results in an infinite set of commuting conserved charges, which might give rise to $W$-hair for the 2d black hole arising in the corresponding string theory at level $k=9/4$. |
| [Quantum Mechanics and Black Holes in Four-Dimensional String Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9112062v1) | J. Ellis, N. Mavromatos, D. Nanopoulos | 1991-12-20 | In previous papers we have shown how strings in a two-dimensional target space reconcile quantum mechanics with general relativity, thanks to an infinite set of conserved quantum numbers, ``W-hair'', associated with topological soliton-like states. In this paper we extend these arguments to four dimensions, by considering explicitly the case of string black holes with radial symmetry. The key infinite-dimensional W-symmetry is associated with the $\frac{SU(1,1)}{U(1)}$ coset structure of the dilaton-graviton sector that is a model-independent feature of spherically symmetric four-dimensional strings. Arguments are also given that the enormous number of string {\it discrete (topological)} states account for the maintenance of quantum coherence during the (non-thermal) stringy evaporation process, as well as quenching the large Hawking-Bekenstein entropy associated with the black hole. Defining the latter as the measure of the loss of information for an observer at infinity, who - ignoring the higher string quantum numbers - keeps track only of the classical mass,angular momentum and charge of the black hole, one recovers the familiar a quadratic dependence on the black-hole mass by simple counting arguments on the asymptotic density of string states in a linear-dilaton background. |
| [Euclidean Black Hole Vortices](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9112065v1) | Fay Dowker, Ruth Gregory, Jennie Traschen | 1991-12-20 | We argue the existence of solutions of the Euclidean Einstein equations that correspond to a vortex sitting at the horizon of a black hole. We find the asymptotic behaviours, at the horizon and at infinity, of vortex solutions for the gauge and scalar fields in an abelian Higgs model on a Euclidean Schwarzschild background and interpolate between them by integrating the equations numerically. Calculating the backreaction shows that the effect of the vortex is to cut a slice out of the Euclidean Schwarzschild geometry. Consequences of these solutions for black hole thermodynamics are discussed. |
| [Generalized Duality in Curved String-Backgrounds](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9112070v1) | Amit Giveon, Martin Rocek | 1991-12-23 | The elements of $O(d,d,\Z)$ are shown to be discrete symmetries of the space of curved string backgrounds that are independent of $d$ coordinates. The explicit action of the symmetries on the backgrounds is described. Particular attention is paid to the dilaton transformation. Such symmetries identify different cosmological solutions and other (possibly) singular backgrounds; for example, it is shown that a compact black string is dual to a charged black hole. The extension to the heterotic string is discussed. |
| [Factorizations of natural embeddings of l_p^n int L_r](http://arxiv.org/abs/math/9201202v1) | Tadek Figiel, William B. Johnson, Gideon Schechtman | 1992-01-06 | This is a continuation of the paper [FJS] with a similar title. Several results from there are strengthened, in particular:   1. If T is a "natural" embedding of l_2^n into L_1 then, for any well-bounded factorization of T through an L_1 space in the form T=uv with v of norm one, u well-preserves a copy of l_1^k with k exponential in n.   2. Any norm one operator from a C(K) space which well-preserves a copy of l_2^n also well-preserves a copy of l_{\infty}^k with k exponential in n.   As an application of these and other results we show the existence, for any n, of an n-dimensional space which well-embeds into a space with an unconditional basis only if the latter contains a copy of l_{\infty}^k with k exponential in n. |
| [An Algorithm to Generate Classical Solutions for String Effective Action](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9201015v1) | S. Kar, S. Khastgir, A. Kumar | 1992-01-07 | It is shown explicitly, that a number of solutions for the background field equations of the string effective action in space-time dimension D can be generated from any known lower dimensional solution, when background fields have only time dependence. An application of the result to the two dimensional charged black hole is presented. The case of background with more general coordinate dependence is also discussed. |
| [A Note on Background (In)dependence](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9201017v2) | Nathan Seiberg, Stephen Shenker | 1992-01-09 | In general quantum systems there are two kinds of spacetime modes, those that fluctuate and those that do not. Fluctuating modes have normalizable wavefunctions. In the context of 2D gravity and ``non-critical'' string theory these are called macroscopic states. The theory is independent of the initial Euclidean background values of these modes. Non-fluctuating modes have non-normalizable wavefunctions and correspond to microscopic states. The theory depends on the background value of these non-fluctuating modes, at least to all orders in perturbation theory. They are superselection parameters and should not be minimized over. Such superselection parameters are well known in field theory. Examples in string theory include the couplings $t_k$ (including the cosmological constant) in the matrix models and the mass of the two-dimensional Euclidean black hole. We use our analysis to argue for the finiteness of the string perturbation expansion around these backgrounds. |
| [Scalar-Tensor Quantum Gravity in Two Dimensions](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9201021v2) | J. Russo, A. A. Tseytlin | 1992-01-12 | We discuss some classical and quantum properties of 2d gravity models involving metric and a scalar field. Different models are parametrized in terms of a scalar potential. We show that a general Liouville-type model with exponential potential and linear curvature coupling is renormalisable at the quantum level while a particular model (corresponding to D=2 graviton-dilaton string effective action and having a black hole solution) is finite. We use the condition of a ``split" Weyl symmetry to suggest possible expressions for the ``effective" action which includes the quantum anomaly term. |
| [Supersymmetric Black Holes](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9201029v1) | Renata Kallosh | 1992-01-15 | The effective action of $N=2$, $d=4$ supergravity is shown to acquire no quantum corrections in background metrics admitting super-covariantly constant spinors. In particular, these metrics include the Robinson-Bertotti metric (product of two 2-dimensional spaces of constant curvature) with all 8 supersymmetries unbroken. Another example is a set of arbitrary number of extreme Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes. These black holes break 4 of 8 supersymmetries, leaving the other 4 unbroken.   We have found manifestly supersymmetric black holes, which are non-trivial solutions of the flatness condition $\cd^{2} = 0$ of the corresponding (shortened) superspace. Their bosonic part describes a set of extreme Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes. The super black hole solutions are exact even when all quantum supergravity corrections are taken into account. |
| [Exact Bosonic and Supersymmetric String Black Hole Solutions](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9201039v1) | I. Jack, D. R. T. Jones, J. Panvel | 1992-01-21 | We show that Witten's two-dimensional string black hole metric is exactly conformally invariant in the supersymmetric case. We also demonstrate that this metric, together with a recently proposed exact metric for the bosonic case, are respectively consistent with the supersymmetric and bosonic $\sigma$-model conformal invariance conditions up to four-loop order. |
| [Quantum Hair on Black Holes](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9201059v1) | Sidney Coleman, John Preskill, Frank Wilczek | 1992-01-28 | A black hole may carry quantum numbers that are {\it not} associated with massless gauge fields, contrary to the spirit of the ``no-hair'' theorems. We describe in detail two different types of black hole hair that decay exponentially at long range. The first type is associated with discrete gauge charge and the screening is due to the Higgs mechanism. The second type is associated with color magnetic charge, and the screening is due to color confinement. In both cases, we perform semi-classical calculations of the effect of the hair on local observables outside the horizon, and on black hole thermodynamics. These effects are generated by virtual cosmic strings, or virtual electric flux tubes, that sweep around the event horizon. The effects of discrete gauge charge are non-perturbative in $\hbar$, but the effects of color magnetic charge become $\hbar$-independent in a suitable limit. We present an alternative treatment of discrete gauge charge using dual variables, and examine the possibility of black hole hair associated with discrete {\it global} symmetry. We draw the distinction between {\it primary} hair, which endows a black hole with new quantum numbers, and {\it secondary} hair, which does not, and we point out some varieties of secondary hair that occur in the standard model of particle physics. |
| [Are Horned Particles the Climax of Hawking Evaporation?](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9201061v2) | T. Banks, A. Dabolkhar, M. R. Douglas, M. O' Loughlin | 1992-01-28 | We investigate the proposal by Callan, Giddings, Harvey and Strominger (CGHS) that two dimensional quantum fluctuations can eliminate the singularities and horizons formed by matter collapsing on the nonsingular extremal black hole of dilaton gravity. We argue that this scenario could in principle resolve all of the paradoxes connected with Hawking evaporation of black holes. However, we show that the generic solution of the model of CGHS is singular. We propose modifications of their model which may allow the scenario to be realized in a consistent manner. |
