# Black Hole Papers

## About the project

This is an automated list of black hole papers, thanks to the arxiv api. (Black holes, hands down, is my favorite cosmic topic.)  
I confess that automation is my way of embracing a bit of laziness. When I finish a book I'm left with the dilemma of what to read next, this would then be a great way to face this issue.

## List of papers

| Title | Author(s) | Date | Abstract |
| :---- | :-------: | :--: | -------: |
| [Exact Black String Solutions in Three Dimensions](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9108001v1) | James H. Horne, Gary T. Horowitz | 1991-08-14 | A family of exact conformal field theories is constructed which describe charged black strings in three dimensions. Unlike previous charged black hole or extended black hole solutions in string theory, the low energy spacetime metric has a regular inner horizon (in addition to the event horizon) and a timelike singularity. As the charge to mass ratio approaches unity, the event horizon remains but the singularity disappears. |
| [String Winding in a Black Hole Geometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9108010v1) | Mordechai Spiegelglas | 1991-08-21 | $U(1)$ zero modes in the $SL(2,R)_k/U(1)$ and $SU(2)_k/U(1)$ conformal coset theories, are investigated in conjunction with the string black hole solution. The angular variable in the Euclidean version, is found to have a double set of winding. Region III is shown to be $SU(2)_k/U(1)$ where the doubling accounts for the cut sructure of the parafermionic amplitudes and fits nicely across the horizon and singularity. The implications for string thermodynamics and identical particles correlations are discussed. |
| [On the Perturbations of String-Theoretic Black Holes](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9108012v1) | Gerald Gilbert | 1991-08-22 | The perturbations of string-theoretic black holes are analyzed by generalizing the method of Chandrasekhar. Attention is focussed on the case of the recently considered charged string-theoretic black hole solutions as a representative example. It is shown that string-intrinsic effects greatly alter the perturbed motions of the string-theoretic black holes as compared to the perturbed motions of black hole solutions of the field equations of general relativity, the consequences of which bear on the questions of the scattering behavior and the stability of string-theoretic black holes. The explicit forms of the axial potential barriers surrounding the string-theoretic black hole are derived. It is demonstrated that one of these, for sufficiently negative values of the asymptotic value of the dilaton field, will inevitably become negative in turn, in marked contrast to the potentials surrounding the static black holes of general relativity. Such potentials may in principle be used in some cases to obtain approximate constraints on the value of the string coupling constant. The application of the perturbation analysis to the case of two-dimensional string-theoretic black holes is discussed. |
| [Superstring Compactification and Target Space Duality](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9108022v1) | John H. Schwarz | 1991-08-26 | This review talk focusses on some of the interesting developments in the area of superstring compactification that have occurred in the last couple of years. These include the discovery that ``mirror symmetric" pairs of Calabi--Yau spaces, with completely distinct geometries and topologies, correspond to a single (2,2) conformal field theory. Also, the concept of target-space duality, originally discovered for toroidal compactification, is being extended to Calabi--Yau spaces. It also associates sets of geometrically distinct manifolds to a single conformal field theory.   A couple of other topics are presented very briefly. One concerns conceptual challenges in reconciling gravity and quantum mechanics. It is suggested that certain ``distasteful allegations" associated with quantum gravity such as loss of quantum coherence, unpredictability of fundamental parameters of particle physics, and paradoxical features of black holes are likely to be circumvented by string theory. Finally there is a brief discussion of the importance of supersymmetry at the TeV scale, both from a practical point of view and as a potentially significant prediction of string theory. |
| [Superstring in Two Dimensional Black Hole](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9108026v2) | Shin'ichi Nojiri | 1991-08-29 | We construct superstring theory in two dimensional black hole background based on supersymmetric $SU(1,1)/U(1)$ gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten model. |
| [Effective Superstrings](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9109008v1) | Zhu Yang | 1991-09-05 | We generalize the method of quantizing effective strings proposed by Polchinski and Strominger to superstrings. The Ramond-Neveu-Schwarz string is different from the Green-Schwarz string in non-critical dimensions. Both are anomaly-free and Poincare invariant. Some implications of the results are discussed. The formal analogy with 4D (super)gravity is pointed out. |
| [Some Applications of String Field Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9109022v1) | Ashoke Sen | 1991-09-12 | We study general properties of the classical solutions in non-polynomial closed string field theory and their relationship with two dimensional conformal field theories. In particular we discuss how different conformal field theories which are related by marginal or nearly marginal deformations can be regarded as different classical solutions of some underlying string field theory. We also discuss construction of a classical solution labelled by infinite number of parameters in string field theory in two dimensions. For a specific set of values of the parameters the solution can be identified to the black hole solution. |
| [String Effective Action and Two Dimensional Charged Black Hole](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9109026v1) | S. Pratik Khastgir, Alok Kumar | 1991-09-14 | Graviton-dilaton background field equations in three space-time dimensions, following from the string effective action are solved when the metric has only time dependence. By taking one of the two space dimensions as compact, our solution reproduces a recently discovered charged black hole solution in two space-time dimensions. Solutions in presence of nonvanishing three dimensional background antisymmetric tensor field are also discussed. |
| [On the connection between Quantum Mechanics and the geometry of two-dimensional strings](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9109027v1) | J. Ellis, N. E. Mavromatos, D. V. Nanopoulos | 1991-09-17 | On the basis of an area-preserving symmetry in the phase space of a one-dimensional matrix model - believed to describe two-dimensional string theory in a black-hole background which also allows for space-time foam - we give a geometric interpretation of the fact that two-dimensional stringy black holes are consistent with conventional quantum mechanics due to the infinite gauged `W-hair' property that characterises them. |
| [Beyond the Large N Limit: Non-linear W(infinity) as symmetry of the SL(2,R)/U(1) coset model](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9109029v1) | I. Bakas, E. Kiritsis | 1991-09-18 | We show that the symmetry algebra of the $SL(2,R)_{k}/U(1)$ coset model is a non-linear deformation of $W_{\infty}$, characterized by $k$. This is a universal $W$-algebra which linearizes in the large $k$ limit and truncates to $W_{N}$ for $k=-N$. Using the theory of non-compact parafermions we construct a free field realization of the non-linear $W_{\infty}$ in terms of two bosons with background charge. The $W$-characters of all unitary $SL(2,R)/U(1)$ representations are computed. Applications to the physics of 2-d black hole backgrounds are also discussed and connections with the KP approach to $c=1$ string theory are outlined. |
| [Elements of String Cosmology](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9109048v1) | A. A. Tseytlin, C. Vafa | 1991-09-25 | Aspects of string cosmology for critical and non-critical strings are discussed emphasizing the necessity to account for the dilaton dynamics for a proper incorporation of ``large - small" duality. This drastically modifies the intuition one has with Einstein's gravity. For example winding modes, even though contribute to energy density, oppose expansion and if not annihilated will stop the expansion. Moreover we find that the radiation dominated era of the standard cosmology emerges quite naturally in string cosmology. Our analysis of non-critical string cosmology provides a reinterpretation of the (universal cover of the) recently studied two dimensional black hole solution as a conformal realization of cosmological solutions found previously by Mueller. |
| [Manifestly $O(d,d)$ Invariant Approach to Space-Time Dependent String Vacua](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9110004v1) | K. A. Meissner, G. Veneziano | 1991-10-01 | An $O(d,d)$ symmetry of the manifold of string vacua that do not depend on $d$ (out of $D$) space-time coordinates has been recently identified. Here we write down, for $d=D-1$, the low energy equations of motion and their general solution in a manifestly $O(d,d)$-invariant form, pointing out an amusing similarity with the renormalization group framework. Previously considered cosmological and black hole solutions are recovered as particular examples. |
| [Open String Theory in 1+1 Dimensions](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9110034v1) | M. Bershadsky, D. Kutasov | 1991-10-14 | We show that tree level open two dimensional string theory is exactly solvable; the solution exhibits some unusual features, and is qualitatively different from the closed case. The open string ``tachyon'' S -- matrix describes free fermions, which can be interpreted as the quarks at the ends of the string. These ``quarks'' live naturally on a lattice in space-time. We also find an exact vacuum solution of the theory, corresponding to a charged black hole. |
| [Superspace WZW Models and Black Holes](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9110035v1) | Changhyun Ahn, Martin Rocek, Kareljan Schoutens, Alexander Sevrin | 1991-10-14 | We show how to write an off-shell action for the $SU(2)\times U(1)$ supersymmetric WZW model in terms of $N=2$ chiral and twisted chiral multiplets. We discuss the $N=4$ supersymmetry of this model and exhibit the $N=4$ superconformal current algebra. Finally, we show that the off-shell formulation makes it possible to perform a duality transformation, which leads to a supersymmetric sigma model on a manifold with a black hole type singularity. |
| [(Super-) String in Two Dimensional Black Hole and Target Space Dualities](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9110044v2) | Shin'ichi Nojiri | 1991-10-17 | We review the recently proposed string theory in two dimensional black hole background. Especially, the structure of the duality in the target space is discussed. The duality is analogous to \lq\lq $R \rightarrow 1/R$" symmetry of a compactified boson. We consider the duality in more general target space manifolds which have Killing symmetries and we give an explicit formula which connects two different manifolds which are dual to each other. Superstring theory in two dimensional black hole background is also discussed based on supersymmetric $SU(1,1)/U(1)$ gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten model. |
| [Generalized Duality and Singular Strings in Higher Dimensions](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9110054v2) | I. Bars, K. Sfetsos | 1991-10-18 | Deformations of gauged WZW actions are constructed for any pair $(G,H)$ by taking different embeddings of the gauge group $H\subset G$ as it acts on the left and right of the group element $g$. This leads to models that are dual to each other, generalizing the axial/vector duality of the two dimensional black hole manifold. The classical equations are completely solved for any pair $(G,H)$ and in particular for the anti de Sitter string based on $SO(d- 1,2)/SO(d-1,1)$ for which the normal modes are determined. Duality is demonstrated for models that have the same set of normal modes. Concentrating on $SO(2,2)/SO(2,1)$, the metric and dilaton fields of the $d=3$ string as well as some of the dual generalizations are obtained. They have curvature singularities and represent new singular solutions of Einstein's general relativity in three dimensions. |
| [Some Exact Solutions of String Theory in Four and Five Dimensions](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9110067v1) | Petr Horava | 1991-10-24 | We find several classes of exact classical solutions of critical bosonic string theory, constructed as twisted products of one Euclidean and one Minkowskian 2D black hole coset. One class of these solutions leads (after tensoring with free scalars and supersymmetrizing) to a rotating version of the recently discovered exact black fivebrane. Another class represents a one-parameter family of axisymmetric stationary four-dimensional targets with horizons. Global properties and target duality of the 4D solutions are briefly analyzed. |
| [Non-Compact WZW Conformal Field Theories](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9110076v1) | Krzysztof Gawedzki | 1991-10-31 | We discuss non-compact WZW sigma models, especially the ones with symmetric space $H^{\bf C}/H$ as the target, for $H$ a compact Lie group. They offer examples of non-rational conformal field theories. We remind their relation to the compact WZW models but stress their distinctive features like the continuous spectrum of conformal weights, diverging partition functions and the presence of two types of operators analogous to the local and non-local insertions recently discussed in the Liouville theory. Gauging non-compact abelian subgroups of $H^{\bf C}$ leads to non-rational coset theories. In particular, gauging one-parameter boosts in the $SL(2,\bC)/SU(2)$ model gives an alternative, explicitly stable construction of a conformal sigma model with the euclidean 2D black hole target. We compute the (regularized) toroidal partition function and discuss the spectrum of the theory. A comparison is made with more standard approach based on the $U(1)$ coset of the $SU(1,1)$ WZW theory where stability is not evident but where unitarity becomes more transparent. |
| [Topological Field Theories and Space-Time Singularity](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9111001v1) | Tohru Eguchi | 1991-11-01 | Based on a study of recently proposed solution of 2 dim. black hole we argue that the space-time singularities of general relativity may be described by topological field theories (TFTs). We also argue that in general TFT is a field theory which decsribes singular configurations with a reduced holonomy in its field space. |
| [On the Evaporation of Black Holes in String Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9111031v1) | J. Ellis, N. E. Mavromatos, D. V. Nanopoulos | 1991-11-18 | We show that, in string theory, the quantum evaporation and decay of black holes in two-dimensional target space is related to imaginary parts in higher-genus string amplitudes. These arise from the regularisation of modular infinities due to the sum over world-sheet configurations, that are known to express the instabilities of massive string states in general, and are not thermal in character. The absence of such imaginary parts in the matrix model limit confirms that the latter constitutes the final stage of the evaporation process, at least in perturbation theory. Our arguments appear to be quite generic, related only to the summation over world-sheet surfaces, and hence should also apply to higher-dimensional target spaces. |
| [Charged Black Holes in Two-Dimensional String Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9111038v1) | Michael D. McGuigan, Chiara R. Nappi, Scott A. Yost | 1991-11-20 | We discuss two dimensional string theories containing gauge fields introduced either via coupling to open strings, in which case we get a Born-Infeld type action, or via heterotic compactification. The solutions to the modified background field equations are charged black holes which exhibit interesting space-time geometries. We also compute their masses and charges. |
| [Instabilities in the gravitational background and string theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9111041v1) | Anirvan M. Sengupta | 1991-11-21 | We indicate the tentative source of instability in the two-dimensional black hole background. There are relevant operators among the tachyon and the higher level vertex operators in the conformal field theory. Connection of this instability with Hawking radiation is not obvious. The situation is somewhat analogous to fields in the background of a negative mass Euclidean Schwarzschild solution (in four dimensions). Speculation is made about decay of the Minkowski black hole into finite temperature flat space. |
| ["the Instability of String-Theoretic Black Holes"](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9111042v1) | Gerald Gilbert | 1991-11-21 | It is demonstrated that static, charged, spherically--symmetric black holes in string theory are classically and catastrophically unstable to linearized perturbations in four dimensions, and moreover that unstable modes appear for arbitrarily small positive values of the charge. This catastrophic classical instability dominates and is distinct from much smaller and less significant effects such as possible quantum mechanical evaporation. The classical instability of the string--theoretic black hole contrasts sharply with the situation which obtains for the Reissner--Nordstr\"om black hole of general relativity, which has been shown by Chandrasekhar to be perfectly stable to linearized perturbations at the event horizon. |
