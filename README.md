# Black Hole Papers

## About the project

This is an automated list of black hole papers, thanks to the arxiv api. (Black holes, hands down, is my favorite cosmic topic.)  
I confess that automation is my way of embracing a bit of laziness. When I finish a book I'm left with the dilemma of what to read next, this would then be a great way to face this issue.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

```shell
pip install arxiv
```

### Access

The list of papers is available in this [README.md](README.md)

But you could access it from [this website](https://ahmedkerouat.github.io/black-hole-papers)

| [Exact Black String Solutions in Three Dimensions](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9108001v1) | James H. Horne, Gary T. Horowitz | 1991-08-14 | A family of exact conformal field theories is constructed which describe charged black strings in three dimensions. Unlike previous charged black hole or extended black hole solutions in string theory, the low energy spacetime metric has a regular inner horizon (in addition to the event horizon) and a timelike singularity. As the charge to mass ratio approaches unity, the event horizon remains but the singularity disappears. |
